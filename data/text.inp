ive been modelling a bus arbiter using my cat
front paws are req lines back paws are ack lines
my cat doesnt seem to like it
and of course tail as busy
the nice thing about cats is that they effectively come in a very large dip package
and they have built in wire strippers
not to be confused with actual strippers as these are teeth
the interface however is decidedly unintuitive
and there is somewhat of a noise issue
however the latter can be beneficial- a properly working device will emit a low purr while a failed device will make a screeching noise
the part is also very well insulated
and has a built in thermal generator for operation under a wide range of temperatures
however it is very difficult to solder
the component contains automatic overcurrent protection; in the event of excess current being drawn the part will remove itself from the circuit and hide under your couch
the overheating protection operates in a similar manner
this will also trigger the screeching noise
the part must be kept well-ventilated and well-fed
